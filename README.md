# monurepo

A collection of Nushell libraries:

- [rescope](./rescope/README.md): scoped resources and deferred execution for Nushell
- [prowser](./prowser/README.md): a prompt-based file browser, based on `std dirs` and `fzf`

The reason to collect them all here is because Nushell currently does not have a default package manager,
and some of these libraries depend on one another.
