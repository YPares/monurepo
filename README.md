# nujj

A set of nushell utility functions wrapping the [`jj`](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) and [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli) CLI tools.

## Usage

E.g. `use <path_to_nujj_folder> *` in a nushell REPL to put `nujj` and `nugh` into scope, with their subcommands.

You can add this `use` line to your `$HOME/.config/nushell/config.nu`
or to any autoloaded nushell script.
