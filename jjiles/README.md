**(TW: puns)**

_In every generation there is a chosen VCS. It alone will stand against the merge conflicts, the code drifts and the forges of darkness._

Us developers are kind of caught in a bat romance with version-control tools. You know, `git` and the things in the same vein.
We both need them and lose many sunlight hours fighting them tooth and claw.
The stakes are high, because who hasn't been bit by a painful drift reconciliation that left them drained?
It is a type o' negative experience that can make even the most cold-blooded of us jump at each other's throats. And that reflects poorly on us.

Recently, `jj` took things to the neck level in the version-control department. It came to slay.
And to every _slayer_ their _watcher_. Enter `JJiles`.
